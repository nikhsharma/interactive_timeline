                In historiography, ancient Rome is Roman civilization from
                the founding of the city of Rome in the 8th century BC to
                the collapse of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th
                century AD, encompassing the Roman Kingdom, Roman Republic
                and Roman Empire until the fall of the western empire. The
                term is sometimes used to refer only to the kingdom and
                republic periods, excluding the subsequent empire.
                </p>

              <p>
                The civilization began as an Italic settlement in the
                Italian peninsula, dating from the 8th century BC, that
                grew into the city of Rome and which subsequently gave its
                name to the empire over which it ruled and to the
                widespread civilisation the empire developed. The Roman
                empire expanded to become one of the largest empires in
                the ancient world, though still ruled from the city, with
                an estimated 50 to 90 million inhabitants (roughly 20% of
                the world's population) and covering 5.0 million square
                kilometres at its height in AD 117.

              <p>
                In its many centuries of existence, the Roman state
                evolved from a monarchy to a Classical Republic and then
                to an increasingly autocratic empire. Through conquest and
                assimilation, it eventually dominated the Mediterranean
                region, Western Europe, Asia Minor, North Africa, and
                parts of Northern and Eastern Europe. It is often grouped
                into classical antiquity together with ancient Greece, and
                their similar cultures and societies are known as the
                Greco-Roman world.
                </p>

              <p>
                Ancient Roman civilisation has contributed to modern
                government, law, politics, engineering, art, literature,
                architecture, technology, warfare, religion, language, and
                society. Rome professionalised and expanded its military
                and created a system of government called res publica, the
                inspiration for modern republics such as the United States
                and France. It achieved impressive technological and
                architectural feats, such as the construction of an
                extensive system of aqueducts and roads, as well as the
                construction of large monuments, palaces, and public
                facilities.

              <p>
                By the end of the Republic (27 BC), Rome had conquered the
                lands around the Mediterranean and beyond: its domain
                extended from the Atlantic to Arabia and from the mouth of
                the Rhine to North Africa. The Roman Empire emerged with
                the end of the Republic and the dictatorship of Augustus
                Caesar. 721 years of Roman-Persian Wars started in 92 BC
                with their first war against Parthia. It would become the
                longest conflict in human history, and have major lasting
                effects and consequences for both empires. Under Trajan,
                the Empire reached its territorial peak. Republican mores
                and traditions started to decline during the imperial
                period, with civil wars becoming a prelude common to the
                rise of a new emperor. Splinter states, such as the
                Palmyrene Empire, would temporarily divide the Empire
                during the crisis of the 3rd century.
                </p>

              <p>
                Plagued by internal instability and attacked by various
                migrating peoples, the western part of the empire broke up
                into independent "barbarian" kingdoms in the 5th century.
                This splintering is a landmark historians use to divide
                the ancient period of universal history from the
                pre-medieval "Dark Ages" of Europe. The eastern part of
                the empire endured through the 5th century and remained a
                power throughout the "Dark Ages" and medieval times until
                its fall in 1453 AD. Though the citizens of the empire
                made no distinction, the empire is most commonly referred
                to as the "Byzantine Empire" by modern historians during
                the Middle Ages to differentiate between the state of
                antiquity and the nation it grew into.
